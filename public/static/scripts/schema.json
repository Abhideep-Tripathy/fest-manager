  "description": "Sports have always been one of the primary channels used by man to quench his thirst for competition as well as promote camaraderie and unity among participants and fans alike. It is the spirit of the game that urges man to dream push his limits, and achieve glory. Once a year, here at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, we allow this spirit to entirely consume us as we host our annual sports fest, Arena. Arena is one of the biggest sporting festivals conducted in India. The preparation ahead of the fest is grueling, the buildup intense, and participation nothing short of mind blowing as we welcome competitors not only from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh but on a national level as well. This year we plan on hosting the 6th edition of Arena, Arena '18. Keeping up with the ambitions and expectations from a campus such as ours, we are envisioning an Arena bigger, grander and more thrilling than ever before. Join us as we compete to the edge of our capabilities, vie for the glory on the field and most importantly enjoy the game.",
